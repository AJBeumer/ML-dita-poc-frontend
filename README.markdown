# ML Treehouse Node Server

This server was extracted from the
[slush-marklogic-node](https://github.com/marklogic-community/slush-marklogic-node)
project. It is currently the default server for the ML Treehouse project.

## Plans

Currently, this server is a rather thin proxy to MarkLogic REST APIs. We plan
to define a somewhat richer interface for it as we build out front-end
components. This will be one example implementation of that middle-tier
interface.
